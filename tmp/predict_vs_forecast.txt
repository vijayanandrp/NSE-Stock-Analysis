Prediction: An estimation of any event happening [in the past, present or future] 
Prediction uses explanatory variables to characterize expected outcome or expected response.
prediction uses explanatory variables or predictors to characterize expectation.
Prediction is the generalize term & it's independent of time.

e.g.
1. Percentage of house owners buying home insurance
2. Predicting amount spend by user for certain case. It's happen over the period of time but not exact.


Forecasting: Is always associated with a time dimension in the future 
Forecasting is the prediction with time as a one of the dependent variable.
i.e. estimation for some specific future duration or over a period of time 
On the other hand, forecasting uses trends in observation to characterize expected outcome or expected response.
In summary, forecasting uses observed response to characterize expectation

e.g. 
1. Total sales in July, 2017. Forecasting is a subset of prediction.
2.  Weather prediction is called forecasting since it's predicted with time as a dependent variable either for quarter or next month etc.
